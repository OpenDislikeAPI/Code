> ###### Inspired by a video by Linus Tech Tips https://youtu.be/Nz9b0oJw69I?t=340

I plan to make a Nodejs API to get the dislike data from Creators such as [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips), [MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000),
[Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkRober) and many other creators who would like to care for thier viewers and share their Youtube(TM) Analytics data with Google's OAUTH.

As Linus said in his [video](https://youtu.be/Nz9b0oJw69I?t=340) <b>creators can help</b>, so let's hope they do their part :)
Also he said, it gets pretty shaddy pretty fast, we are making this thing open source so at least it gets.... ah, less shaddy i guess? also you can view our code and check what we collect and understand why we collect. We plan to make it in such a way that it becomes easy for anyone to sign up and basically no maintanence needed after that. 

# Much more coming here soon :)
